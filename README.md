# findfox

Send remote commands to a specific Firefox instance, using its remote protocol
over DBus.

## Usage

### List Instances

With no arguments, `findfox` will print the Firefox instances found in DBus. It
also tries to decode the profile name from the identifier.

Example:

```console
$ findfox
d29yaw__       work
YmFua2luZw__   banking
cGVyc29uYWw_   personal
```

The first column is the identifier generated by Firefox. In the [current
implementation], this identifier is the profile name encoded as Base64, but the
characters `+`, `/`, `=`, and `-` are replaced with `_`.

To get the original name, `findfox` assumes that all `_` are `=`, and then
decode the string as Base64. If the original string contains any one of `+`,
`/`, or `-`, the decode will fail. It is still possible to send commands to that
instance, because `findfox` only requires the generated identifier.

### Send Commands

To send a remote command to a Firefox instance use the following command:

```
findfox send $ID args*
```

`args*` is the command line required by Firefox.

For example, to open `https://example.com` in a private window:

```console
$ findfox send d29yaw__ firefox --private-window https://example.com
```

## Compatibility

The implementation is tested against Firefox 94.
